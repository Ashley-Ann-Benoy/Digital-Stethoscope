# Digital Stethoscope  
A **digital stethoscope** that amplifies, filters, and digitally processes heart sounds for enhanced diagnostics and remote monitoring.  
**Project Outline** //
We intend on developing a digital stethoscope system which includes an acoustic sensor that is attached to the processing unit, which will catch the signal, amplify it using an amplifier circuit using op amp TL082.
The amplified signal is then sent to the ATMEGA328-P, which then converts the analog signal to a digital one ,which is then displayed as a waveform on the LCD TFT screen.  We intend to 3D printing an enclosure which will offer mechanical support and keep the enclosure compact.
